# GAN for increasing LLA dataset

## Description:
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a critical hematologic malignancy requiring accurate and early diagnosis. However, the limited availability of labeled medical data, particularly for ALL cases, poses a significant challenge to developing robust machine learning models. This study explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the ALL dataset by generating synthetic medical images or data samples that closely resemble real patient data. The GAN model is trained to capture the complex distribution of ALL features, thereby producing high-quality synthetic samples that enrich the dataset and mitigate class imbalance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating GAN-generated data improves the performance of classification models, suggesting that GAN-based augmentation is a promising strategy for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in ALL detection
